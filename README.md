## 🚀 Overview

**3D Viewer** is a privacy-focused, client-side visualization engine integrated natively into Google Drive.

It solves the "Download Fatigue" problem for engineers and designers. Instead of downloading a 500MB `.3dm` or `.stp` file just to check a version, you can right-click and view it instantly in the browser.

> **Note:** This repository serves as the official **Issue Tracker** and **Documentation** hub. The core rendering engine is proprietary, but we use this space to collaborate with the community on features and bug fixes.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Native CAD Support:** View **Rhino (.3dm)**, **STEP (.stp)**, and **IGES** files without expensive license keys.
* **Universal Mesh Support:** fast rendering for **STL**, **OBJ**, **FBX**, **GLB**, **glTF**, **PLY**, and **3DS**.
* **Privacy First:** We use a client-side rendering engine. Your files are downloaded directly from Google Drive to your browser's memory. They are **never** uploaded to our servers.
* **Collaboration:** Context-aware commenting system. Click a vertex -> Leave a note.
* **Google Integration:** Works with the "Open With" menu in Drive.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

We built this tool for professionals who are under NDA.

* **No Cloud Uploads:** Unlike Sketchfab or Autodesk Viewer, we do not re-host your file.
* **OAuth Scopes:** We strictly use `drive.file`, meaning we only have access to the specific files you choose to open. We cannot scan your entire Drive.
* **Data Sovereignty:** Your IP stays in your Google Drive.
